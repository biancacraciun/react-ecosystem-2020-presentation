# react-ecosystem-2020-presentation

Lets take a deep dive into what happened this year in the React ecosystem. We'll cover new libraries that appeared, that work well with the new React APIs, like Suspense or hooks, API communication, state management, bundlers and other experiments that are React related.
We'll encounter some innovative libraries that solve problems you didn't knew you have; Spin up some 2D or 3D graphics, build CLIs or create CSS classes all React. And if we still have time, we'll go even further in an adventure into the land of Jamstack.
