# What is an ecosystem?

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components
of their environment, interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are
linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows

# State management

**_General Synopsis:_** Redux is great, but it requires a lot of boilerplate and feels a bit incomplete.
Even with the the released guidelines and good practises, it gives you just a low level tools.
A lot of developers have started using it too soon, and they are just dragging around what is now legacy code.
Making Redux play well with typescript is something that you can mess up if you don't know typescript very well.

It has what redux added as best practices in it's guide, built-in and ready to use.
On top of this you also get some usefull and fancy features like:

- immutable data (using proxies just like immerjs does)
- operators (for RX fans)
- state machines, that help a lot when dealing with complex business logic
- state classes, which allows you to breaks away from keeping only primitives in state
- typescript as a first citizen
- lazy reducers

It's a whole lot easier to test, and can be automated using snapshots.
Even comes with a devtool that enables you to prototype how the application will behave
without writing any of an actual UI.
It's not specific to react, it supports: Angular, Vue and even Svelte

This does not deviate too far from Redux, but for me, it seems much easier to use.
I even like how you can use it with hooks. The slices of state can be defined in a single file,
having reducers, how the data can change, and even effects.

You get some nice controll on when the components updates if you read the documentation end to end.
It a bit more ahead of its time than some other sollutions and supports typescript and works well
with micro frontends. It uses `immerjs` under the hood.
Only caveat is to make sure your actions don't call other model action and end up in circular loop.

This is not an alternative that is production ready, but it's worth mentioning since it
was the first that introduces the idea of atoms, which are slices of application state.
Though their documentation website lacks substance, other libraries borrowed their idea,
and improved uppon it. Even if it's developed by Facebook, it didn't got the same traction.

Feels like a library that tries to solve the shortcoming of `useReducer` and `useState`
I don't really understand why their API is forcing you to provide an unique identifier each time.

Jotai state is within React component tree, which means that you don't have the same developer experience as with Redux.
It consists on atoms, that build a bottom-up tree, just like recoil.
This moves away from the Redux architecture completly, but it does perform better whith code splitting and Suspense.
It makes it easier to understand which components needs which atom or slice of state, and you can build a dependency graph.
Even further you can derive new atoms based on existing ones.

It is a very low level tool that is powerfull enough to carry enterprise grade applications if used correctly.
It supports typescript out of the box

It is marketed as

> a small, fast and scaleable bearbones state-management solution.
> Has a comfy api based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated, but still just enough to be explicit and flux-like.

In a lot of ways is similar to jotai, but instead of atoms you still have the classic redux slices. You can select multiple slices,
which prevents poluting the import statements, but the catch is that you need to pass in some extra diffing algoritms (shallow is provided as an export).
It gives you a bit more flexibility to bundle slices that depends on each other into a single store, and create more stores when neeed.
Each store has it's own `useStore` hook that you can use, and create a dependency tree just like jotai. If you still want to use reducers you can trick zustard
into thinking it works like Redux.
It also has it's own devtools, and integrates easier with Typescript than redux.

Developed by Vercel, it makes the whole Suspense feature reather useless. Usually your applications use state
management to keep track of the data that is fetched and the result. Without this responsability on the develelopers
sholders, you should be able to iterate faster with your features, and focus only on the local state a component has.

It has a lot of features like data polling, revalidate data when tab is focused or when the network is recovered,
number of retries, pagination support, and local mutations for optimistic UI updates.

I know, this is imposible, but imagine if you write a React component that receives a user property,
and your data fetching layer knows what it automagically needs for it to render.

Even if this is not a product ready library, it sets a tone in how the new feature of ES6, `Proxys` can
be used in metaprograming and generate GraphQL queries, using dot notations or some hook like utilities.
I would love to see more experiments like these.

Want to use hooks in tandem with GraphQL? Say no more! Simply provide a client and you can hook your way in
using a `useQuery` to fetch any GraphQL information you need to render you React component.
It works well with SSR and file uploads, using some plugin like architecture, called exchanges.

This is is how you can even customize how the client persists data, and how it detects when to invalidate it, or add
other features like retry, authenticate or how your application haves when it no longer has network connectivity
It is one of the most feature complete GraphQL clients I've seen recently released, with a small footprint

# Bundlers

## Rollup

Is as awesome as ever, and a lot of tools build on top of it, because it has an easier interface to develop plugin in it,
whereas webpack requires you to know a lot of the internals. Used by `Svelte`, `vite` and `parcel`

## Parcel

Parcel has shaken the balance of a webpacks monopoly, with it's zero config mentality. It is currently struggleing to release
the v2, definitly something to look up to. Sadly the documentation is lacking some of the hidden features, but it's posibile
to find more insight in their github issues section. Using v2-beta in production is not advised.

---

# Bundlers

## Webpack

The most popular bundler in this group has just launched its v5 with performance improvements. Since its a mature product you
can do a lot of things with it, using plugins to optimize it's build time, though sometimes its hard to keep with all of the
changes. Knowing its history, it definitly improved towards a more 0 configuration, having default behaviours builtin, but its
still more flexible than parcel. With module fedaration it will bring the micro frontends architecture to a new level.

## CRA

It recently release it's `v4`, that enables react-refresh and webpack improvements. Unless you already ejected, it is very easy to
upgrade. `create-react-app` enables you to start a project without breaking a sweat. You can take it a bit further, and use `react-app-rewire`
to fit your needs, without ejecting. I personaly went with this approach and it paid off.

---

# Bonus

## EsBuild (https://github.com/evanw/esbuild)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evanw/esbuild/master/images/benchmark.png" />

It's a compiler, like `babel`, but powered by golang. It's easy to find the plugin, loader or what ever you need to replace
your uglify or terser minifier to this one. It also supports typescript, and might be a better alternatives than tsc, from my
findings on the web

---

# Bonus

## Nx (https://nx.dev/react)

This one might become a bit absolute since webpacks module federation is now in place, managing monorepos might become easier. On top of this,
one of the issues was rebuilding the entire project on each change, which now with `esbuild` should be as fast the speed of light. One of the cons
is that the templates are a bit opinionated and not as flexible as using `lerna`, but it has some nice features like detecting affected packages
and showing a dependency graph of them.

Adobe is a bit late to the party, but it did join the React hype train. It promotes it's own design system,
a system based on 50 shades of gray. The good part is can be easily customized to fit your needs using a theme provider.
It's unique way of having the UI system split in 3 repositories might help you reduce the size, and have some clean code:
`React Spectrum` has the set of components, `React Aria` exposes hooks that you can use to make the application as accesible
as posible, whereas `React Stately` handles how the exchange of data happens in your application.

The other side of the knife cut is that you need some very organized and disciplined engineers to work with such a system,
that is a bit overegineered. But this as complete as it can get from a UI system perspective.

One of its maintainers is the `parcel` lead developer, so no surprise React Spectrum is using parcel for the build system.
Is this why `parcel v2` is delayed?

Airbnb is one of the companies that are not afraid to opensource their code. And they usually do it with flare. They are realy
involved in the React community. `visx` is one more reason why the above statement is true.

They are not reinventing the wheel with this library, but it does give you some nice visualisation graphs that you can use in your
projects. Powered by `d3`, it's one of the libraries that you have to glue the code yourself, here is where it's documentation website shines.
The entire documentation website is one big NextJS application, meaning that these graph are indexable by google!

It has React components that you can use to consume the data provided by some utility functions (that are actually d3 functions).
This is how React should be used with d3. Usually people just mount the svg in the page and let `d3` to take care of the entire work.

It's modular and has every component it its own repository and very similar to https://nivo.rocks/

Since we've been talking a lot about the web side of React, this time, we have a library specific only for
React native. It definitly looks better than material designs based libraries.
When it comes to the number of components it exposes, they are in the low, but should be enought to create
a small application on top of it.

By now you can guess I'm a fan of what Vercel, formerly known as zeit are doing for the open source community. And this time,
they outdone themselvs with this ui library that has all of the basic components you need plus some specific ones like: `Capacity`, `Dot`,
`File-Tree`, `Keyboard`, `Snippet` and `CSSBaseline`. They have a very nice visual language and some tasty `Toast` components.
They have the customization part handed over on a plate to us by having a page where you can create your theme.
The only thing that bugs me is that they don't have a scrollbars!!!!!

This library has a clean design with a dash of gradients beeing overused.
Nothing too fancy, but a solid library none-the-less. It is a well deserved break from material like libraries
I wish more components were shown as example in their documentation webiste.

One of the early React adopters, the creators of `react-canvas`, disapoited with their
components library. There is no way of theming it, but at least their documentation website
is well executed (better than the one from the previous slide)
I guess since mostly Pinterest has one job, that it does well, their UI library is limited to
what they need. There is no wow factor.

# Bonus round

You want your own UI system? Don't want to deal with CSS?

https://xstyled.dev/docs/system/
This should make your library as flexible as posible, since it exposes some low level
mixins that you can use with either styled components or emotion to handle properties that
will customize the way your base will look like. It's highly inspired from https://styled-system.com/

https://storybook.js.org/
This can act as a business card for your library.
You can even automate snapshot tests on top of it using jest

https://loki.js.org/
Regression testing done on top of storybook with ease.
It doesn't create conflicts when using different OSs.

# Hooks

# Hooks

React is becoming more of a runtine which is a good thing, because the javascript language is limited,
We might even see a transition to a different language http://rescript-lang.org/. ReScript, formaly known as ReasonML
has builtin support for React and had `hooks` way before they were even introduced in React. How? The guy who created React
is also the creator of Reason, a language that has all of the shortcomings of the javascript language all figured out.
Its strongly typed, has pattern matching and compiles to JS and it can even be used to create native application, yes!

Enough ranting! Resuming our normal program.

# Hooks

`useImperativeHandle`, the least popular hook of them all, might one day save your life.

# Hooks

I like reading the source code of libraries. Hey have so much to teach us.

https://www.react-spring.io/ will make your mind blow in million pieces. It's one of the projects that rellys heavily on the
`useImperativeHandle` hook.

Add flare to your website. From animations to interations like drag and drop, to even paralax scrolling.
From my oppinion is my go-to library if it'd like to animate things in react. It has a bit of a learning curve but it will be
worth it if used with other libraries from the same author

---

# Hooks

https://formidable.com/open-source/renature/ Is does just the animation part of react-spring. It is considerly smaller, but maintains the same
idea of of passing properties to the element you want to animate.

---

# Hooks

https://reach.tech/router/ This is not just a hook, but you might be very familiar with it (as a hook) if you are using Gatsby
It has a small footprint and its way more flexible than the react router, promising a better API for users to interact with
It would be my go-to router if I'd start a new project. Passing just the route name to a comonent, nested routes is just a dream
You can programaticaly move to a route using either the hook or the service itself. React router v4 just ruined everthing for me.

---

# Hooks

https://frontarm.com/navi/en/ Oh another router! I guess I was too lazy to create a different category for routers. Here is a different one.
What this one does a better job than some other routers in the market is that it handles initial data request to the server, making it
an excelent candidate for people in the quest of finding a library that plays well with SSR or SSGs.
Navigation can be done programaticaly using a hook or a service!

# Hooks

https://kea.js.org/docs/introduction/what-is-kea
Their docs website left me with a contusion.

>Kea is a production-grade state management framework built for ambitious React apps.
>It scales really well as your application grows and helps keep your state neat and clean.

What ever that means... Digging further, I found an very opiniated, inflexible API designed to furstrate me.
What this "framework" does is to reduce the boilerplate you need to manage your state, by offering to handle some Redux interations (yes, its actually
a redux store)... Overusage of hooks

---

# Hooks

http://motion-layout.azurewebsites.net/
Hook that allows you to transition from one state to another, even if the next state is in a different layout.
Usefull to create cool transition between pages and more. I'm limited by my creativity here. You can get some mobile level transitions

Way more usefull than kea, since it solves a real problem.

# Experiments

My favorite section. Let us begin!
https://github.com/pmndrs
This guy is just awesome.

https://github.com/pmndrs/react-nil An reconciler that render null. Might look like an experiment that went wrong, but it's not the case
Imagine you can run React anywhere, with a javascript enviroment. Node? Yes. Controll a canvas drawing, API backend React style, anything!
And the entire ecosystem is there for you to use.

https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber
The entire ThreeJS library to used a components. Performant and it iterates fast to improve it even further.
Version 5.1. now. It began as beta at the begining year. Their example include a spaceship game running at 60fps

https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx
Need a 3D model in React? Done!

Yes, he is the guy behind zustard and jotai.

---

# Experiments

https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight Dealing with highlighting code?
Want to customize the hell out of the output? `lowlight` evaluates strings and gives you the tokens for you to itterate over.
If only rendering is needed it has a `react-lowlight` wrapper.
`highlight.js` is needed in the project to register languages. If you want to use `prism` there is `refractor` and `react-refractor`

---

# Experiments

https://flume.dev/ Cross from programming to visual programming using this tool. There will be a time when figma or some of the design tools out there
will embrace this to help designers code. Just an experiments but this how the future is shaped. One step at a time

---

# Experiments

https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink Need to build a CLI? You would be amazed by how vast the CLI landscape is.
If you still want to use React, you can do it using this library. You can create layouts, input fields like controlls and other components that handy.
It's used by most of the tools that we are using, like yarn, parcel, gatsby and so on.
Their examples includes a lot of other libraries that you should use if you want your CLI to be cutting edge.

---

# Experiments

https://reactpixi.org/ React but for 2D. Includes most of the low level components PixiJS has. Enought to build a game.
You have a very nice state management system combine it with this library then you should be able to build your game in no time.
It's toolkit includes particles, meshes, image morphing capabilities, sprites and even tilling sprites.
Typescript enabled.

# Experiments

https://github.com/gregberge/react-teleporter
Slot and fills is one concept that has been arround in React. Preact has its own implementation. This allows you to change the parent of a component
while maitaining a the same owner.
This for people that want to experiment with modular designs.
